# ai-for-healthcare-hackathon
Team Medical Explorers @ DERBI AI for Healthcare Hackathon Code Base

We used a total of 5 datasets for our project - 3 datasets with Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) scans of the retina and 2 datasets with Fundoscopic images of the retina. Of these datasets, 3 were provided officially as a part of the Hackathon while 2 were obtained through external sources with appropriate permissions, compliance and attribution.

We developed a web application for showcasing the model developed for predicting diseases based on the approach given in the Final_Kermany+Dataverse_3class notebook. Web App was developed in Flask, with frontend developed using Bootstrap and Javascript used to improve responsiveness of the app. Users can insert any image and the model will predict the corresponding class with probability score as well as display the gradient heat map for the given image.

Final_Kermany+Dataverse_3class notebook (Kaggle) & Hackathon GUI folder have the code & Flask scripts for the implemented GUI.
